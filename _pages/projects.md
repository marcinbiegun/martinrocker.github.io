### Blender script for exporting font characters as 3d models (2019)

A script for Batch conversion of single font characters to extruded OBJ models.

Uses Blender and Inkspace from command line interfaces. Is pretty slow but results are good.

## Coding experiments

Some of my older web-dev related works.

### My coding exercises (2018-2022)

A collection of programs I've wrote during learning from courses and tutorials.

### Elixir-tanks (2020)

Elixir-based multiplayer realtime 2D zombie shooter. This was an
experiment on implementing a game in ECS.

## Web tools

### Taskpaper to Slack (2019)

I've written this program while working at ContractBook where according to "oversharing is good for remote teams"
rule we've had a habit of publicly sharing (and updating) our daily todo lists on Slack. This tool automates the process.

It works only with [Taskpaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/) ($30) plain-text todo app.

Written in Go. Parsing text files is a bit tedious in Go, but the overall coding experiece was pretty good. The program is smal (in memory) and portable.

### Github portfolio generator (2018)

[https://github.com/marcinbiegun/go-githubportfolio](https://github.com/marcinbiegun/go-githubportfolio)

This tool generates static files that display well at GitHub. I use it for GitHub-style portfolio for my
creative-coding sketches project.

It's written in Go, I've used to lean Go at this time. The upside is that go programs are very portable, but
working with YAML is very painful (YAML is very dynamic awhile Go is strict). I would use Ruby script next time for similar project.

### Domain names generartor and availability checker (2012)
