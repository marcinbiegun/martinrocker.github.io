Here you can find a list of my side-projects, there's some tools or smaller experiments that hasn't made it to the [portfolio](/portfolio) page.

## Side-projects I'm currently working on


 <a href="#" class="btn btn--primary">This is a button</a>



[Text](#link){: .btn .btn--primary .btn--small}

<p class="notice">Warning!</p>

- I'm working on a small UE5 game, hopefully a playable pre-production prototype will be released in 2022!

- Learning the intricacies of C++.

- Creative explorations. Notch is my favourite tools for prototyping abstract pieces, Unreal Engine is great for building
  environments. I also learn random Tech Art stuff: animations, procedural animations, I use Houdini for that.

## Creative Coding Experiments

### UnityMidiSpawer (2019)

A simple project where objects spawning is synchronized with music data (MIDI files).

### My random sketches library (2018)

A collection of my creative coding doodles I've created during my early days of learning different creative conding toolkits.

## Creative Coding Tools

### Touch Designer ISF shaders importer (2020)

![isf-touchdesinger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcinbiegun/isf-touchdesigner/master/docs/screenshot.png)

A Touch Designer tool allowing it to run ISF pixel shaders. Uses Python script to parse the ISF shader,
make it run in TD, exposes predefined parameters.

### Blender script for exporting font characters as 3d models (2019)

A script for Batch conversion of single font characters to extruded OBJ models.

Uses Blender and Inkspace from command line interfaces. Is pretty slow but results are good.

## Coding experiments

Some of my older web-dev related works.

### My coding exercises (2018-2022)

A collection of programs I've wrote during learning from courses and tutorials.

### Elixir-tanks (2020)

Elixir-based multiplayer realtime 2D zombie shooter. This was an experiment on implementing a game using ECS pattern.

The experiment has proved that building ECS systems in Elixir doesn't make any sense.

### Elixir-datascience (2019)

An exploration in data processing capabilities using Elixir language.

Includes a solution for a puzzle requing to feed a Monte Carlo text generator with the whole [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) containing millions of records.

## Web tools

### Wheel of fortune web based party game (2021)

### Membrane-msdk (2020)

### Taskpaper to Slack (2019)

I've written this program while working at ContractBook where according to "oversharing is good for remote teams"
rule we've had a habit of publicly sharing (and updating) our daily todo lists on Slack. This tool automates the process.

It works only with [Taskpaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/) ($30) plain-text todo app.

Written in Go. Parsing text files is a bit tedious in Go, but the overall coding experiece was pretty good. The program is smal (in memory) and portable.

### Github portfolio generator (2018)

[https://github.com/marcinbiegun/go-githubportfolio](https://github.com/marcinbiegun/go-githubportfolio)

This tool generates static files that display well at GitHub. I use it for GitHub-style portfolio for my
creative-coding sketches project.

It's written in Go, I've used to lean Go at this time. The upside is that go programs are very portable, but
working with YAML is very painful (YAML is very dynamic awhile Go is strict). I would use Ruby script next time for similar project.

### Docker packaging for Sendy open-source mailing app (2017)

[https://github.com/marcinbiegun/docker-sendy](https://github.com/marcinbiegun/docker-sendy)

### Readability to Instapaper exporter (2012)

### Domain names generartor and availability checker (2012)

### VIM syntax highlighting for PolServer Ultima Online emulator (2011)
