![Martin Rocker with Zbytniu](/assets/images/with-zbyniu-1251x1024.jpg)

I’m a self-taught (late diagnosed neuroatypical) software developer generalist who enjoys solving complex problems with simple solutions.

I have 10 years of experience working as a software developer for webdev projects in multiple roles. 2020 was the year when I’ve decided to pivot my career towards more creative endeavors and started working as a game developer.

My current interests include but are not limited to 3D graphics, game mechanics, real-time audio-visual experiences, and procedural art creation. I still enjoy doing Linux and devops projects.
