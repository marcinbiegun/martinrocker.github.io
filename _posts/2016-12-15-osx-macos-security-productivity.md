I was pretty impressed that my previous OSX install had served me for
4 years of heavy software development and daily personal use.

But a time has come for a fresh system reinstall.
During the setup, I had some troubles
remembering all useful system settings and tweaks I've made, so here's
the list for my future reference, and possible use for other power users.

### Apps

### Utility Apps

- [Karabinier](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) - a tool for remapping keys
  - Replace CapsLock with ESC
  - Switch `right command` with `right alt` (for easier access to polish diacritic chars)
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) (free or \$25) - application launcher and a swiss army knife
  - Bind `CMD + F1`, `CMD + F2`, etc. to app activate, my most used apps are Chrome, MacVim, and iTerm
  - Add a task to task manager's inbox, e.g. `inbox Buy milk`
  - Some custom scripts, e.g. `j GR-123"`command to open Jira ticket

  password manager
